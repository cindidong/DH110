### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
The purpose of UX storytelling is to put yourself into your user's shoes to better understand how to design the product for your target audience. In my case, I brainstormed 3 users/personas with varying prior knowledge on music theory and reasons to learn about music theory. To put myself in their shoes, I created empathy maps and journey maps to understand their pain points.
