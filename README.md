# Learn Music Theory 
## Cindi Dong
### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
### Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
### Competitor Analysis
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

#### Usability Testing
See more [here](https://cindidong.github.io/DH110/Assignments/2/).

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
The purpose of UX storytelling is to put yourself into your user's shoes to better understand how to design the product for your target audience. In my case, I brainstormed 3 users/personas with varying prior knowledge on music theory and reasons to learn about music theory. To put myself in their shoes, I created empathy maps and journey maps to understand their pain points.

### Low-fidelity prototype
#### Scenarios
- Harold Miller is a 65 year old man who is looking to learn guitar to play along to his favorite band, the Beatles. He just needs to learn how to read sheet music, and is not very tech savvy. He needs a simple, easy to navigate website or else he will get overwhelmed. Since he's a beginner, his scenario consists of him discovering the website and starting from the beginning with the first lesson.
- Olivia Garcia is a 11 year old girl learning how to play piano. She needs to learn music theory to improve at piano, but is very easily distracted and full of energy (as she is a child). She needs a heavily interactive website, with lots of content to keep her entertained. Olivia is also a beginner, so her scenario consists of her discovering the website and completing the first lesson as well.
- John Williams is a 45 year old man who has prior knowledge of music theory. He is currently going through a music production course, and needs to brush up on some concepts. He needs to be able to easily search for a particular concept, and learn it quickly. His scenario sees him jumping from lesson to lesson. He originally discovers the website to learn about chords, but needs to complete the major scales lesson before continuing with the chords lesson.
From these scenarios, I came up with new features:
#### Landing/Front Page
- Landing page is the table of contents.
- Remove the giant advertising for the paid app version, users will buy the app if they enjoy the free content (can add a link for more paid lessons at the end of the table of contents)
#### Lessons
- Textbook format (all text with interactive elements scattered in-between)
- Interactive elements (quizzes at the end of the lesson, opportunities to play the piano or the chords themselves)
- Once you click on the menu button, it opens to a mini table of contents without going back to the table of contents page

I created the following tasks to showcase the new features:
#### Tasks
1. ![#D3455B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D3455B/000000?text=+) Find the first lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines), then go to the next lesson (Note Duration), then go back to previous lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines).
2. ![#1AAE9F](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1AAE9F/000000?text=+) Find a particular lesson (the Major Scale), then go to a particular lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines).`
3. ![#730FC3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/730FC3/000000?text=+) Find the paid content/app.
The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping to take these tasks created from the process I've detailed above to develop visuals. This allows for testing of my new features' functionality and integration with the website before investing time and effort into actual development.

### Interface Design
I created typographic, shape, and color variations, then ran an impression test. I also ran a color contrast check, and developed my design system.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

See more [here](https://cindidong.github.io/DH110/Assignments/7/).
### Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)
See more [here](https://cindidong.github.io/DH110/Assignments/7/).
### Pitch video 
### Conclusion: 
What did you learn throughout the process?
