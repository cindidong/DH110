#### Usability Testing
I chose https://www.musictheory.net/ as the website I was going to redesign. This was because I thought it was a little more interesting content wise, with animations. I then ran an usability test on https://www.musictheory.net/ to understand what a target user would think of this website.

#### Summary
- The participant did not explore the website/click around as much as I expected, and didn't discover that the lessons were animations. They did not click the forward or backwards arrows to advance the animation, and instead focused on reading the script below to obtain the information.
- The participant did not end up finding the sound button in the lesson that plays the intended sound.
- The participant had trouble discovering the free lessons, as they clicked on the large cards redirecting to the paid app.
- The participant would not have discovered some features (image mode) without prompting from the task.
- From this, I learned to keep the website simple, so everyone could easily figure it out. Extra features are unnecessary if no one can discover them. Likewise, I learned to keep the advertising for the paid apps to a minimum.

### User research
After the usability test, I wanted to see how users would actually use the website using contextual inquiry. Thus, I conducted a participatory observation/interview with a participant who was interested in music. This interview gave me some key insights into how my target demographic actually wanted.

#### Summary
- The participant preferred in-person classes.
- The participant was only interested in music theory to supplement and improve their other musical pursuits (piano and singing), and thus preferred music theory lessons to be tailored to their weak points.
- Intermediate music theory learners would not actually use this website. As someone who is an intermediate level in music theory, the participant noted that the lessons themselves were not as detailed as they should be and that even the more advanced topics weren't as advanced as I had thought. This changed my target users to just beginners, and not intermediate users looking for a quick refresher or for more advanced lessons.
- The participant preferred a more textbook format. This was because the textbook format (a page with all the information laid out in text on it) allowed them to quickly scan for relevant information. As https://www.musictheory.net/ is more interactive and has animations/slideshows, it's much harder to quickly scan through the entire lesson for relevant sections. An intermediate level in music theory would do this a lot more than beginners.
- The participant didn't want to spend too long looking for a music theory resource. During their search for a music theory resource, they Googled "music theory educational resource" and clicked on the first link.
- From this, I learned that most users aren't interested in music theory on its own, instead learning music theory to supplement their other musical pursuits. Thus, they prefer a more simple design (textbook format) with interactive elements to keep it fresh.

### UX storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to put yourself into your user's shoes to better understand how to design the product for your target audience. In my case, I brainstormed 3 users/personas with varying prior knowledge on music theory and reasons to learn about music theory. To put myself in their shoes, I created empathy maps and journey maps to understand their pain points.

### Low-fidelity prototype
#### Scenarios
- Harold Miller is a 65 year old man who is looking to learn guitar to play along to his favorite band, the Beatles. He just needs to learn how to read sheet music, and is not very tech savvy. He needs a simple, easy to navigate website or else he will get overwhelmed. Since he's a beginner, his scenario consists of him discovering the website and starting from the beginning with the first lesson.
- Olivia Garcia is a 11 year old girl learning how to play piano. She needs to learn music theory to improve at piano, but is very easily distracted and full of energy (as she is a child). She needs a heavily interactive website, with lots of content to keep her entertained. Olivia is also a beginner, so her scenario consists of her discovering the website and completing the first lesson as well.
- John Williams is a 45 year old man who has prior knowledge of music theory. He is currently going through a music production course, and needs to brush up on some concepts. He needs to be able to easily search for a particular concept, and learn it quickly. His scenario sees him jumping from lesson to lesson. He originally discovers the website to learn about chords, but needs to complete the major scales lesson before continuing with the chords lesson.

From these scenarios, I came up with new features:
#### Landing/Front Page
- Landing page is the table of contents.
- Remove the giant advertising for the paid app version, users will buy the app if they enjoy the free content (can add a link for more paid lessons at the end of the table of contents)
#### Lessons
- Textbook format (all text with interactive elements scattered in-between)
- Interactive elements (quizzes at the end of the lesson, opportunities to play the piano or the chords themselves)
- Once you click on the menu button, it opens to a mini table of contents without going back to the table of contents page

I created the following tasks to showcase the new features:
1. ![#D3455B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D3455B/000000?text=+) Find the first lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines), then go to the next lesson (Note Duration), then go back to previous lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines).
2. ![#1AAE9F](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1AAE9F/000000?text=+) Find a particular lesson (the Major Scale), then go to a particular lesson (the Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines).`
3. ![#730FC3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/730FC3/000000?text=+) Find the paid content/app.
The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping to take these tasks created from the process I've detailed above to develop visuals. This allows for testing of my new features' functionality and integration with the website before investing time and effort into actual development.

#### Wire Flow Testing Summary
- The participant was confused on why paid content is a separate app instead of the same platform (a website). Suggested to keep on same platform, and just unlock more content on the website with a purchase.
- Table of Contents button: The participant was confused if Table of Contents button in header leads back to the table of contents page, or a popup menu. They were also confused if you had to click or hover over the Table of Contents in the header.
- Table of Contents Popup Menu: The participant thought the menu would be annoying if there's lots of lessons. Suggested having only section headers that you can click on to reveal all the lessons in the section instead, to reduce clutter.

### High-fidelity prototype
Using the low-fidelity prototype, I developed some interface designs and turned them into high-fidelity prototypes using Figma. I have two prototypes, as Figma does not save the state. Therefore it's difficult to include the completed lessons/user progress within my main flow. Thus, I have a prototype with a more strict path/flow (displaying all the elements within the website), and a more flexible prototype with less features included, so the user can click around and get a general feel for things (doesn't display completed lessons and have purchase history).

### Evaluation and revision history 
#### Impression Test
I created typographic, shape, and color variations, then ran an impression test. I also ran a color contrast check.

##### Summary
- The participant could tell immediately that the website was for learning music theory, and thought it looked interesting. 
- The participant preferred the font Jost, as they described it as having more "character" than the other fonts. 
- The participant preferred rounder buttons, but stated that this might be a personal preference. They did not like the rectangle buttons, stating that it makes the website look unfinished. 
- The participant preferred a higher contrast between the background and the text.

#### Cognitive Walkthrough
I conducted this cognitive walkthrough in class, with my peers. [Link to Comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOS-NN-_a3UrTWoGuX56GD1WqbyoErZwoCBFRIQ4-U8/edit)

##### Summary
- Participants all commented that there was no way for a user to feel as if they're making progress towards their goal (learning music theory).
- Participant thought the purple link color was confusing (as purple usually means a link has already been visited). They liked the idea of it being obviously a link, and recommended making it blue instead (for an unvisited link).
- Participants thought the discrepancy between the "Free Music Theory Lessons" card on the Home page and "Table of Contents" button in the NavBar was confusing.

##### Summary
- Participant was able to navigate around the new website much more easily than the old version.
- Participant liked the new design/color palette of the website.
- Participant thought website was boring with no interactive elements within the lesson (which I had planned to include, but I couldn't find any to put into my prototype).
- Participant went to the My Account page first to find the completed lessons, then went to the Table of Contents page. Ultimately, they said they preferred the completed lessons/user progress to be presented as a checkmark next to the completed lesson's name in the Table of Contents page instead of listed in the My Account page.
- Participant caught my error of not connecting the sign up popup to the "Sign up to unlock more content" text in the Table of Contents page. The "Sign up" part of the text is in the unvisited link color, which caused them to click on the "Sign up" part. Nothing happened, as I had forgotten to connect this to the sign up popup.
