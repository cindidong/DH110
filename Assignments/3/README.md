# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry by Cindi Dong

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> The main activity my project would need to support for users is providing a fun, easy to understand way to learn about music theory.
#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
> This activity fulfills a user's cognitive need, as it fulfills the need to acquire information/learn (specifically learning about music theory).
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> Traditional solutions would be to take paid music theory lessons/classes in-person, either in a classroom/group setting or in a one-on-one lesson.
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
> Music theory lessons in-person usually cost money, and require a set time commitment each week that might not be feasible for people with changing schedules. Technology can be utilized in the form of a dynamic website to make these lessons available, free, and able to be accessed whenever the user has free time.

### Step 2: Target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)
> - Demographics: Anyone who is interested in learning about music theory, but probably on the younger side (10 years old to 50 years old) since this is a website.
> - Preference: Users who have no experience with music theory up to users who are at an intermediate level with music theory (who might need a quick refresher on basic concepts or want to learn a more advanced concept). Those who are too advanced probably wouldn't need the lessons on the website.
> - Expertise: There are some more advanced lessons on the website, so the expertise level regarding music theory could range from beginners to intermediate. 
#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
> Users would typically use this website in their free time in their home. If they wished to learn about music for their own benefit/hobby, they would access this website in their free time probably in their own homes. Likewise, those who wanted use this website as a supplement to a music theory class would also probably access this website in their free time in their own homes.
#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
> The goal of the user is to learn about music theory. To do so, they could search for a website that provides music theory lessons, which would possibly bring them to https://www.musictheory.net/. After finding a website they are satisfied with, they would either go through all the lessons, or pick and choose the lessons they want to learn. Users may also seek out an in-person class (at a local college, etc), or private in-person lessons, which wouldn't lead them to https://www.musictheory.net/.

### Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
I conducted participatory observation/interview with 2 activities, further explained in Step 4. I spilt the interview into 6 sections:
1. Introduction
> I gave the participant some background into this interview, expectations, and asked for consent to record.
2. Background Questions
> I started with some demographic and screening questions to ensure the participant was within the target demographic. Then, I asked some questions regarding their background with music theory and any other resources they have used for music theory before.
3. Activities
> I observed the participant's normal procedure for choosing a music theory resource to learn from, so I could see what requirements a user would have for a music theory resource. Then, I observed their first experience with https://www.musictheory.net/, to see if they would use the website of their own volition.
4. Problems with music theory learning
> I asked the participant what problems they have faced while trying to learn music theory to see if the website can mitigate these issues.
5. Different kinds of music theory learning methods
> I asked more specific questions about the music theory learning the participant has done, especially offline.
6. Wrap-up
> I asked what the perfect music theory learning website would look like for the participant, to gather some insight into what they desire. I also asked for any questions they had for me.

### Step 4: Plan the details
I decided it would be best to conduct this interview virtually, as users would normally use the website in their free time in their homes. Thus, the interview was conducted virtually through Zoom, in the participant's free time in their own home. In addition, it is easy to record and generate a transcription through Zoom. Thus, I collected the data through video recording and the corresponding transcript. I decided to observe the participant's normal procedure for choosing a music theory resource to learn from, and the participant's first experience with https://www.musictheory.net/. To do this, I chose to conduct a participatory contextual inquiry. Here is my [Contextual Inquiry Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MENiQkyaTjGfZXIbzgMB-SQlrYFlQPhaaWYZ8NjBbQc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Reflection
I had a lot of trouble finding a participant in the target demographic of mid-aged men who are interested in music learning. The closet one I had was my pilot UT participant, who I would've asked to do this assignment instead if I had known. This assignment's participant was at least interested in music learning, but is not in my target demographic. There's nothing I can really do about this, as I don't have much contact with mid-aged men, or mid-aged people in general, that I could ask and who would accept without some kind of payment for their time. Nevertheless, I learned a lot from running this interview with the participant, especially because they had prior music theory knowledge.

I found this interview much easier to do than my UT - perhaps this was because the UT gave me prior experience being in the moderator/interviewer role. Similar to the UT, the participant was very good at talking through their thoughts, which I appreciated. They even answered some of my questions before I even asked them. Thus, it felt more like a natural conversation, rather than a strict interview. For this reason, I did go a little off script and didn't explicitly ask the questions they had already answered in the previous question. Likewise, I added some additional questions as I was curious about the participant's thought process for some decisions. I didn't have this in my script, but I was interested to see the participant compare the [website](http://openmusictheory.com/) found in activity one to https://www.musictheory.net/, so I asked questions about that. I tried my best to stay neutral and not lead the participant to an answer, and I think I improved a lot on that aspect from the UT (although it is easier to do here, as there aren't really rigid tasks with steps to follow). Overall, I found this interview very valuable, and some insights I learned from it are below.

## Insights
The participant preferred in-person classes.
> "I think that I would prefer it being taught to me by someone else who I can actually talk to and interact with and ask questions to, or in a group where the people I'm with I can also ask them questions, or we can like discuss our line of reasoning for reaching a certain answer, as opposed to just learning by myself. I think that I like having someone to to bounce my ideas off of and to talk through my process with, as opposed to just a static wall of a self-guided online lesson, because there's plenty of nuances in music theory, especially when it comes to applying it to certain situations in performance and practice that you're not necessarily going to be able to learn about if you just teach yourself. So for that reason, I would definitely prefer an in-person or group format." (44:53)

The participant was only interested in music theory to supplement and improve their other musical pursuits (piano and singing), and thus preferred music theory lessons to be tailored to their weak points.
> "But I think that for me music theory has been kind of more of a vehicle for me to improve in my performance, so that's the only reason why I even engaged in music theory in the first place, but I don't think that I'm as interested in the theory itself." (2:50)

> "What it would cover is pretty much everything that I would need to know for the particular capacity that I need to know it for. I don't think that I would need an extensively super formal training if I'm just using it to play music for fun, or just casually. Just something that's tailored to my needs, but that I can still have the opportunity and space to think out loud about and discuss it with, and at least maybe enjoy it as I learn too." (47:57)

One of the most surprising insights from this interview was that intermediate music theory learners would not actually use this website. As someone who is an intermediate level in music theory, the participant noted that the lessons themselves were not as detailed as they should be and that even the more advanced topics weren't as advanced as I had thought. This changed my target users to just beginners, and not intermediate users looking for a quick refresher or for more advanced lessons.
> "I think that for different types of audiences - maybe if this was for someone who had much less experience, and they just wanted to know the bare minimum, and maybe they were a younger child, or they just have more trouble learning about new information in general, then this one [musictheory.net] would make a lot more sense for them to do." (30:22)

Another surprising insight was that the participant preferred a more textbook format. This was because the textbook format (a page with all the information laid out in text on it) allowed them to quickly scan for relevant information. As an intermediate level in music theory, they would do this a lot more than beginners. As https://www.musictheory.net/ is more interactive and has animations/slideshows, it's much harder to quickly scan through the entire lesson for relevant sections.
> "I don't think that I could just scan for information. I would definitely have to manually click through the entire lesson and maybe by the time I’ve clicked through the entire lesson, then I’ve realized that actually there was nothing in here that I was looking for at all because they didn't clearly state what kind of information that they were presenting well enough. Whereas in the other one [openmusictheory.com], you could see right away they've got the headings, the subheadings, the different sections. You could just do a quick scan, and you could know exactly where you need to be" (39:10)

Another insight that fell in line with my UT testing was that the participant didn't want to spend too long looking for a music theory resource. During their search for a music theory resource, they Googled "music theory educational resource" and clicked on the first link.
> "But I think that if I had a very general kind of idea in mind, like if I was looking for just a basic resource on music theory - if I had to spend too much time trying to find something like that, which is so general, simple and widely known that it shouldn't really be a problem at all, then I think that I would probably get impatient much faster and not be as satisfied once I finally got to that point." (19:22)

I also found it interesting that the participant immediately found elements that the UT participant had trouble with (finding the free lessons page, clicking through the animations). This is probably because the participant was younger than the UT participant and had more experience navigating websites.
