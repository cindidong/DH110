# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry by Cindi Dong

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

### Step 2: Target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)
> - Demographics: Anyone who is interested in learning about music theory, but probably on the younger side (10 years old to 50 years old) since this is a website.
> - Preference: Users who have no experience with music theory up to users who are at an intermediate level with music theory. Those who are too advanced probably wouldn't need the lessons on the website.
> - Expertise: There are some more advanced lessons on the website, so the expertise level regarding music theory could range from beginners to intermediate. 
#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?
> Users would typically use this website in their free time in their home. If they wished to learn about music for their own benefit/hobby, they would access this website in their free time probably in their own homes. Likewise, those who wanted use this website as a supplement to a music theory class would also probably access this website in their free time in their own homes.
#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
> The goal of the user is to learn about music theory. To do so, they could search for a website that provides music theory lessons, which would possibly bring them to https://www.musictheory.net/. After finding a website they are satisfied with, they would either go through all the lessons, or pick and choose the lessons they want to learn. Users may also seek out an in-person class (at a local college, etc), or private in-person lessons, which wouldn't lead them to https://www.musictheory.net/.

### Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
I conducted participatory observation/interview with 2 activities, further explained in Step 4. I spilt the interview into 6 sections:
1. Introduction
> I gave the participant some background into this interview, expectations, and asked for consent to record.
2. Background Questions
> I started with some demographic and screening questions to ensure the participant was within the target demographic. Then, I asked some questions regarding their background with music theory and any other resources they have used for music theory before.
3. Activities
> I observed the participant's normal procedure for choosing a music theory resource to learn from, so I could see what requirements a user would have for a music theory resource. Then, I observed their first experience with https://www.musictheory.net/, to see if they would use the website of their own volition.
4. Problems with music theory learning
> I asked the participant what problems they have faced while trying to learn music theory to see if the website can mitigate these issues.
5. Different kinds of music theory learning methods
> I asked more specific questions about the music theory learning the participant has done, especially offline.
6. Wrap-up
> I asked what the perfect music theory learning website would look like for the participant, to gather some insight into what they desire. I also asked for any questions they had for me.

### Step 4: Plan the details
I decided it would be best to conduct this interview virtually, as users would normally use the website in their free time in their homes. Thus, the interview was conducted virtually through Zoom, in the participant's free time in their own home. In addition, it is easy to record and generate a transcription through Zoom. Thus, I collected the data through video recording and the corresponding transcript. I decided to observe the participant's normal procedure for choosing a music theory resource to learn from, and the participant's first experience with https://www.musictheory.net/. To do this, I chose to conduct a participatory contextual inquiry.
