# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry by Cindi Dong

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

### Step 2: Target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

### Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own

### Step 4: Plan the details
Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually
Decide what activities to observe
Decide how to interact with the users (ex. overt x participatory if it is contextual inquiry)
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the (interview + observation) guide
