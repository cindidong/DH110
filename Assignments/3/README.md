# DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry by Cindi Dong

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

### Step 2: Target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

### Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own

### Step 4: Plan the details
I decided it would be best to conduct this interview virtually, as users would normally use the website in their free time in their homes. Thus, the interview was conducted virtually through Zoom, in the participant's free time in their own home. In addition, it is easy to record and generate a transcription through Zoom. Thus, I collected the data through video recording and the corresponding transcript. I decided to observe the participant's normal procedure for choosing a music theory resource to learn from, and the participant's first experience with https://www.musictheory.net/. To do this, I chose to conduct a participatory contextual inquiry. Here is my [Contextual Inquiry Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MENiQkyaTjGfZXIbzgMB-SQlrYFlQPhaaWYZ8NjBbQc/edit?usp=sharing).
