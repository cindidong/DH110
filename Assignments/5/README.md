## Reflection
I found using Whimsical to create wire frames/wire flows was much easier than drawing it out (at least for me). However, I did get kind of carried away with designing it compared to if I just drew it out, as it was pretty fun to add new elements. It's definitely not the final design, but it does have more design than wire frames/wire flows usually have. When creating the wire frames/wire flows, I took into account the feedback I was given in my UT and CI. Those participants had found the website somewhat confusing. Likewise, one of my personas was Harold Miller, an elderly man who isn't tech savvy. Therefore, I wanted to keep the website simple and easy to understand. I believe I succeeded, as the participant had no trouble navigating through the website and I managed to predict their actions with my original wire flow pretty well. I also wanted to ensure the website was suitable for those with prior music theory knowledge, due to the participant in my CI and my persona John Williams. I converted the format to a textbook format, allowing for fast scans through the content. Likewise, I wanted to keep in mind my young, distractible persona of Olivia Garcia. I kept her in mind when I added interactive elements to the lessons.

I struggled with deciding what to keep from https://www.musictheory.net/. The original website has an exercises tab, which has exercises to practice music theory. This is located in a different paid app than the paid app for music theory. I placed these exercises in the corresponding lesson that taught the skills needed for the exercises, because I thought it would be better to combine these two functions into one and this provides more interactive elements in a lesson. Likewise, I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep the paid app or have any content locked behind a paywall. I eventually decided to keep some content locked in the paid app, as this website doesn't have ads or any other income source to support itself. However, the participant noticed this, and pointed out that it didn't make sense for the paid content to be in an app format when the free content was in a website format. They pointed out that this website was like a "free trial", and the user should be able to access more music theory lessons in the same website once they pay. For this, the user needs to be able to create an account. Therefore, I need to add more wire frames and wire flows for the account creation process, the payment process, the user's account page (delete account, keep track of user's progress, etc), and what the new content looks like (shouldn't be different in format from free content, just more advanced topics). The other pointers the participant gave me could be addressed by a working website (seeing the mouse hover over something, etc). In addition, I had expected the participant to return to the previous lesson by clicking the previous lesson button (at the bottom of the lesson page), but they just used the browser back button. I think it had to do with the task, as they had just been on the previous lesson. If I had asked them to go to the previous lesson from a random lesson, they wouldn't have been able to use the browser back button and would have had to use the previous lesson button.
