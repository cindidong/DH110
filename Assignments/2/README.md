# DH110 Assignment 2: Usability Testing by Cindi Dong

## Introduction
The purpose of this UT is to test the usability of https://www.musictheory.net/ for the target demographic of mid-aged men who are interesting in music learning. To create the tasks, I focused on some of the heuristics the website failed to satisfy in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/cindidong/DH110/tree/main/Assignments/1).

#### 1: Visibility of system status
- There is sound for some animations in a particular lesson, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. However, this button is hard to see as it's small.

#### 2: Match between system and the real world
- Some animations in a lesson have sound, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. It can also be played when the same sound icon on the bottom is not greyed out and is pressed (see picture in 1: Visibility of system status). However, I thought this button was the volume control for the first method to play the sound (the sound icon to the left of the content/script), and not a button to press for the actual sound to play. This is because most websites use that particular sound icon for volume control.

#### 3: User control and freedom
- A convention for most lesson based websites is to have a next button for next lesson in the current lesson's page. This allows the user to easily navigate to next lesson. In this website, the user has to remember which page/lesson they're on to navigate to the next page/lesson. To go to the next lesson, you have to click on the home button on the top of the lesson, which takes you back to the table of contents page. Then, you have to remember the lesson you just were on, search for it in the table of contents, then click on the next lesson.
- Similarly, there is no button to go back to the previous lesson/page, in case the user wants to revisit the last lesson.

#### 4: Consistency and standards
- There is an option to view the lesson in image mode, instead of the standard slideshow mode. In the image mode, there are no animations and only images. This is understandable, as it is called image mode. However, there is also no sound option. Thus, the modes are not consistent with each other and the user is missing information when on image mode.

#### 5: Error prevention
- The user may accidentally click on the slider on the bottom of the screen and skip to an unintended part of the lesson.

#### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
- A search function should be implemented, so users just looking for one particular concept can just search for it.

Most of these were issues with navigation throughout the website/lessons and how the user interacts with the content. Likewise, I tried to think of common tasks the target demographic would do, such as navigating to the free lessons page and playing the digital piano included on the website.

Thus, I came up with 6 tasks. Task 1 is to find and navigate to the free lessons page. Task 2 is to search for the lesson about the major scale, and to go through the lesson as normal to play the corresponding sound for the C scale. Task 3 is to find the image mode. Task 4 is to find the digital piano popup. Task 5 is to navigate to the next lesson. Task 6 is to navigate to the previous lesson.

## Methodology
I ran this UT over Zoom, with the moderator (me) located in a quiet place in Los Angeles, California and the participant located in a quiet place somewhere else. The participant shared their screen through Zoom with the website open, and had a different computer open with the Google Form survey. I also had the Google Form survey/script open on my phone, and recorded the participant's screen through Zoom. Both of our cameras were on, so we could see each other's facial expressions. I edited the video (see more information in UT Video Link section) with iMovie. As the participant progressed through the survey, she completed the informed consent, background questions, pre-test questionnaire, 6 tasks, post-test questionnaire, SUS, production satisfaction, and confidential demographic questions.

Notes:
- The participant was getting frustrated and wanted to take a break at around 13:45, so I just cut it from the recording.
- We also ran into screen sharing problems at around 15:33 (she wasn't sharing her entire screen), so I just cut the part out where we figured that out.
- Likewise, I ended the recording before the participant filled out the demographics questions.
