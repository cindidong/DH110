The participant was getting frustrated and wanted to take a break at around 13:45, so I just cut it from the recording.

We also ran into screen sharing problems at around 15:33 (she wasn't sharing her entire screen), so I just cut the part out where we figured that out.

Likewise, I ended the recording before the participant filled out the demographics questions.

## Reflection
