# DH110 Assignment 2: Usability Testing by Cindi Dong

## Introduction
The purpose of this UT is to test the usability of https://www.musictheory.net/ for the target demographic of mid-aged men who are interesting in music learning. To create the tasks, I focused on some of the heuristics the website failed to satisfy in [Assignment 1](https://github.com/cindidong/DH110/tree/main/Assignments/1) summarized below. Most of these were issues with navigation throughout the website/lessons and how the user interacts with the content. 

#### 1: Visibility of system status
- There is sound for some animations in a particular lesson, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. However, this button is hard to see as it's small.

#### 2: Match between system and the real world
- Some animations in a lesson have sound, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. It can also be played when the same sound icon on the bottom is not greyed out and is pressed (see picture in 1: Visibility of system status). However, I thought this button was the volume control for the first method to play the sound (the sound icon to the left of the content/script), and not a button to press for the actual sound to play. This is because most websites use that particular sound icon for volume control.

#### 3: User control and freedom
- A convention for most lesson based websites is to have a next button for next lesson in the current lesson's page. This allows the user to easily navigate to next lesson. In this website, the user has to remember which page/lesson they're on to navigate to the next page/lesson. To go to the next lesson, you have to click on the home button on the top of the lesson, which takes you back to the table of contents page. Then, you have to remember the lesson you just were on, search for it in the table of contents, then click on the next lesson.
- Similarly, there is no button to go back to the previous lesson/page, in case the user wants to revisit the last lesson.

#### 4: Consistency and standards
- There is an option to view the lesson in image mode, instead of the standard slideshow mode. In the image mode, there are no animations and only images. This is understandable, as it is called image mode. However, there is also no sound option. Thus, the modes are not consistent with each other and the user is missing information when on image mode.

#### 5: Error prevention
- The user may accidentally click on the slider on the bottom of the screen and skip to an unintended part of the lesson.

#### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
- A search function should be implemented, so users just looking for one particular concept can just search for it.

Likewise, I tried to think of common tasks the target demographic would do, such as navigating to the free lessons page and playing the digital piano included on the website. After this process, I came up with 6 tasks.

#### Tasks
1. Find and navigate to the free lessons page. 
2. Search for the lesson about the major scale, and to go through the lesson as normal to play the corresponding sound for the C scale. 
3. Find the image mode. 
4. Find the digital piano popup. 
5. Navigate to the next lesson. 
6. Navigate to the previous lesson.

## Methodology
I ran this UT over Zoom, with the moderator (me) located in a quiet place in Los Angeles, California and the participant located in a quiet place somewhere else. The participant shared their screen through Zoom with the website open, and had a different computer open with the Google Form survey. I also had the Google Form survey/script open on my phone, and recorded the participant's screen through Zoom. Both of our cameras were on, so we could see each other's facial expressions. I edited the video (see Notes in UT Video Link section for what I edited) with iMovie. As the participant progressed through the survey, she completed the informed consent, background questions, pre-test questionnaire, 6 tasks, post-test questionnaire, SUS, production satisfaction, and confidential demographic questions.

#### Notes
- The participant was getting frustrated and wanted to take a break at around 13:45, so I just cut it from the recording.
- We ran into screen sharing problems at around 15:33 (she wasn't sharing her entire screen), so I just cut the part out where we figured that out.
- I ended the recording before the participant filled out the demographics questions, and thanked the participant after completion.

## Reflection
I learned quite a lot during this pilot UT, both about how to conduct a proper UT and the usability of the website itself. I learned that I wasn't a very good moderator. I found it so frustrating to not really be able to help out the participant when they ask for help. I also found the balance between providing some help and full on guiding the participant to the answer extremely difficult. For example, when the participant found the paid lesson page for iPhone and iPad, they were about to check off the box for "finding the free lessons page" (which they didn't do). I gave them a hint that it wasn't the free lesson page by saying "is this the free lessons page?". I should have said something more neutral like "could you read the task again?". Likewise, I provided too much guidance for finding the image mode, as I continued to repeat the description of the image mode when they thought they found it (but they were actually still in the animation/slideshow mode). I should have just told them to reread the task instead, and told them to move on to the next task if it took too long. I did similar things throughout the UT, and definitely guided the participant too much. In the future, I should focus on improving my responses to questions to prevent guiding the participant to an answer. Likewise, I found it very difficult to contain my facial expressions/body language. This is partly because I was testing my mom, and I'm familiar with her. In the future, I will try to not make too many facial expressions. In addition, I worded some tasks poorly, as I was trying not to give away what I'm asking for. For example, in Task 2, the survey states "tell the moderator all the notes in the C major scale and play the scale out loud". I wanted the participant to find the sound button either on the left of the script or on the bottom of the screen. During the UT, the participant thought I was asking them to play the scale on the piano. If the survey had said "find the sound button for the C scale", this could have been avoided. However, the participant would have known about the sound button's existence and searched for it. In this case, I learned that the participant did not notice the sound buttons at all (as I didn't mention it in the task), but I could have seen that they didn't notice the sound buttons even if I mentioned it in the task (as they would have to search for the sound button). In the future, I should make the task descriptions more clear and direct, as I would have known the participant wouldn't have noticed the sound buttons anyways.

I also learned that issues I viewed as major usability issues weren't actually that important, and those I viewed as minor usability issues were actually more important than I thought. I also learned not to assume everyone has the same technical capabilities or approach to exploring a website. Some key takeaways from this UT was that it was difficult for the participant to find the free lessons page, and if they couldn't find it easily they would have just closed the website. Likewise, the participant didn't figure out that there were animations, instead of a static image with a script below. They didn't click the next button or click on the script itself to discover the animations, which was what I expected. This illuminates an overall trend of the participant not clicking around to explore the website as much as I expected a new user to do. They tended to have a purpose behind every click, instead of clicking around randomly like I normally do. I was also surprised to see that they thought the site design was boring and unoriginal, as I thought the design was clean and simple. I really appreciated how my participant communicated all their thoughts about the website with me and was engaged with the UT. Overall, I still felt like I learned a lot of valuable things from this UT, even though I did guide the participant too much.
