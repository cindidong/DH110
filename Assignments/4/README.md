#### Scenario
##### Why?
> Harold has always loved the Beatles, and they have been his favorite band since his youth. He especially loves their iconic guitar lines, and has always wanted to be able to play along with them. Now that he finally has time for his interests after his retirement, he has been learning guitar for about 3 months. However, Harold realized he needed to learn how to read sheet music to be able to play along, but he doesn't want to use his retirement funds to pay for in-person lessons. He calls his daughter to tell her about his dilemma, and his daughter suggests a free website to learn music theory.

##### How?
> Harold opens his email, and clicks on the email from his daughter containing the free music theory website link. He copies the website link and pastes it on the search bar of his browser instead of clicking on the link, and is taken to the website. Harold is greeted with a table of contents, or a list of all the lessons grouped by section, instead of a landing page with links to the paid apps (he would have trouble finding the free music lessons page). He reads the first couple section names, and realizes he doesn't know these concepts. Thus, he clicks on the first lesson in the first section. This takes him to the lesson page, which is formatted similar to a textbook (the information is laid out as text on a single page, with images and interactive elements sandwiched in-between the text), instead of a slideshow of animations (which would be confusing to him, and he wouldn't click around to figure out how to see the animations). He reads through the lesson, and continues onto the next lesson with the next button at the bottom of the lesson. Once finished with both lessons, he decides he had enough for the day. He bookmarks the page (as his daughter taught him) for next time and closes the browser.
