# DH110 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Cindi Dong
## Music Theory
I had originally planned to do my analysis on two music/beat composition websites, as I am interested in how music is created. However, I found most of these websites required some basic music theory knowledge to begin with through this process. I don't know much about music, so I thought it would be better for me to focus on music theory for beginners instead. Thus, the purpose of my project is to provide a clean, easy to understand website to learn music theory. To do, I will analyze two music theory websites through the lens of [Jakob Nielson's usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [Nielsen Norman Group's severity ratings for usability problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/). Both of these websites were found through a simple Google search for music theory.
