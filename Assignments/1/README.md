# DH110 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Cindi Dong
## Music Theory
I had originally planned to do my analysis on two music/beat composition websites, as I am interested in how music is created. However, I found most of these websites required some basic music theory knowledge to begin with through this process. I don't know much about music, so I thought it would be better for me to focus on music theory for beginners instead. Thus, the purpose of my project is to provide a clean, easy to understand website to learn music theory. To do, I will analyze two music theory websites through the lens of [Jakob Nielson's usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and [Nielsen Norman Group's severity ratings for usability problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/). Both of these websites were found through a simple Google search for music theory.
## Website 1: [Method Behind the Music](https://method-behind-the-music.com/)
### About
I found Method Behind the Music through a Google search for music theory, similar to how the target audience of mid-aged men might find it. It is a simple website aimed at teaching music theory for all skill levels. In addition to this, they also have information on instruments and music history. The website has a table of contents on the left side, where the user can navigate to the lesson they need.

### Heuristic Evaluation
#### Overall Evaluation
This website has major issues, mostly relating to the difficulty of lesson/page navigation with the table of contents. A complete revamp of this feature should be the main area of focus. Likewise, this website has the basic HTML design of older websites, which makes it look uninteresting. Overall, this website wouldn't be suitable for the target audience of mid-aged men. The issues further discussed below would cause confusion for even those who are tech literate, much less mid-aged men.

## Website 2: [Music Theory](https://www.musictheory.net/)
### About
I found Music Theory through a Google search for music theory, similar to how the target audience of mid-aged men might find it. There are free music theory lessons, exercises, and tools. There are also paid premium apps for music theory, which they advertise heavily in the landing page. I will only be analyzing the [free music theory lessons section](https://www.musictheory.net/lessons), as this is the focus of my project (and I don't want to pay for the apps).

The [free music theory lessons section](https://www.musictheory.net/lessons) also serves as the table of contents, where you can view each section, subsection, and a short description of each subsection.

### Heuristic Evaluation
This website is obviously designed as a mobile app, even though it's a website. This is probably because this is a free preview of their paid music theory app. However, this means that many features of this website do not make sense. Music Theory should focus on redesigning specifically with a website in mind, rather than reusing the mobile app design. Similar to The Method Behind the Music, they also have issues with lesson navigation, which they should focus on to make the experience much less frustrating for the user. Thus, these issues and the ones further discussed below create a confusing experience for mid-aged men.

#### 1: Visibility of system status
- Once inside the particular lesson, there is no way to tell which section/chapter your current lesson is under. (2)

*Solution: Add the current chapter to the title of the current lesson page, i.e. "The Basics: The Staff, Clef, and Ledger Lines".*
- There is no indication on how many lessons are left in the section/chapter the lesson is in. (2)

*Solution: Add the number of lessons left in the chapter to the title of the lesson page, i.e. "The Staff, Clef, and Ledger Lines (1/12)".*
- There is sound for some animations in a particular lesson, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. However, this button is hard to see as it's small. (3)

*Solution: Automatically play the sound when on the animation slide.*

#### 2: Match between system and the real world
- A convention for most lesson based websites is to have a next button for next lesson in the current lesson's page. This allows the user to easily navigate to next lesson. In this case, going to the next lesson means clicking on the home button on the top of the screen, which takes you back to the table of contents page. Then you have click on the next lesson, which is a lot of work. (3)
*Solution: Add a back button on the top.*
- Some animations in a lesson have sound, which can be played by pressing the sound icon on the left of the content/script. It can also be played when the same sound icon on the bottom is not greyed out and is pressed. However, I thought this button was the volume control for the first method to play the sound (the sound icon to the left of the content/script), and not a button to press for the actual sound to play. This is because most websites use that particular sound icon for volume control. (2)
*Solution: Change the sound icon to a play icon (to play the sound)*
